# Recursion
####Recursion is a sci-fi horror short film built in the Unity game engine.

The film follows a lone spaceman who, after a sudden crash landing, arrives in a dark dimension of endless barren grassland. With resources scarce, the spaceman ventures forth, slowly discovering that he is no longer alone in this world.

This project was built as my senior degree project at Massart. I worked on the majority of the assets including the programming, modelling, animation, and rigging. I worked with a sound designer for the score and an SFX artist for the foley. Additionally I worked with a UI artist to built the space helmet HUD. It took about 9 months to complete, and the film was screened at the animation departmental show at the Museum of Fine Arts in the spring of 2016.
